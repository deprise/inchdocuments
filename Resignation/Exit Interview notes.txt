Good company culture and team, fun activities and team building, strong promotion to brand and values, quality training, amazing colleagues and teammates

What do you think are areas for improvement for your Team, Platform and the DDC?
Even though this is a homegrown IT company, it would be beneficial for employees to have the opportunity to connect with clients as if they were consultants themselves. Additionally, I hope there will be more opportunities for leadership exposure and training.

Suggestions or comments?
If I have the opportunity to work at Inchcape Digital again, I would be delighted. Please continue driving growth for your businessâ€”it's the shared vision that propels Inchcape forward.
