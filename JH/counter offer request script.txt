"I wanted to bring this to you before making a final decision. I've received a strong offer from another company, and while I haven't signed yet, it's made me think about my career growth and future here. 

I value my time at [company], and I’d love to understand if there’s a path forward that aligns with my long-term goals.

===========================
Do you have reevaluations after the contract ends

I had my keen interest on the offer
although I wanted to ask, can there be flexibility on the base salary

since the market for full stack salesforce and integration is competitive

I am hoping to have it at 85k

I am considering the longevity and growth and how I am comfortable with your offer
